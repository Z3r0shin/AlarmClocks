I want to make an alarm clock that has fm radio, bluetooth speaker, sd card and an lcd to control it all with its touchscreen.

To resume the hardware part, I have :
an ESP32 wroom
an ili9341 with an xpt2046 touch controller
a max98357
a micro sd spi module
a RDA5807M

the ili9341 is connected to the esp32 like this:
VCC to 5v
GND to ground
CS to G15
Reset to G4
DC to G2
SDI(MOSI) to G23
SCK to G18
LCD to 3.3v
MISO is unused
Touch interface MOSI to G23
Touch interface CS to G17
Touch interface SCK to G18
Touch interface Data Out to G19

For the MAX98357 :
LRC to G25
BCLK to G26
DIN to G27
VIN to 3.3v
GND to ground

For the RDA5807M :
ROUT to G34 (its an ADC1 pin making it the best)
VCC to 3.3v
GND to ground
FMIN to an external 75cm antenna
SCLK to G22
SDIO to G21

for the micro sd module :
3.3v to 3.3v
GND to ground
MOSI to G23
MISO to G19
CS is G5
CLK is G18 except if it interferes with the others on the same pin

The sd card module will only serve as a small storage/swap.

All audio output should use the MAX98357 I2S interface, wether its the radio, the sd card, the alarm clock or the bluetooth speaker. If the audio is analogue, use the ESP32's ADC1 channel to transform that signal to digital to then output is to the I2S to the MAX98357.

Its going to be written in arduino btw.

The libraries that I think we can use are the following :
audio_tools
ESP32_A2DP
pu2clr RDA5807
TFT_eSPI

All 5 of them have been added in the chat files for you. If there are other libraries that you think would be relevant, do not hesitate to add them.

Let's start with something simple and then we will add on the wanted features later.

I want you to make a sketch taht will play the radio. It should take the output of the rda5807, turn it into digital signal, output it to the max98357 in i2s form so i can hear radio. don't forget the pins already determined before and don't forget to add the serial commands to control the radio please.
