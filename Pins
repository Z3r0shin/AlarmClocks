To resume the hardware part, I have :
an ESP32 wroom
an ili9341 with an xpt2046 touch controller
a max98357
a micro sd spi module
a RDA5807M

the ili9341 is connected to the esp32 like this:
VCC to 5v
GND to ground
CS to G15
Reset to G4
DC to G2
SDI(MOSI) to G23
SCK to G18
LCD to 3.3v
MISO is unused
Touch interface MOSI to G23
Touch interface CS to G17
Touch interface SCK to G18
Touch interface Data Out to G19

For the MAX98357 :
LRC to G25
BCLK to G26
DIN to G27
VIN to 3.3v
GND to ground

For the RDA5807M :
ROUT to G34 (its an ADC1 pin making it the best)
VCC to 3.3v
GND to ground
FMIN to an external 75cm antenna
SCLK to G22
SDIO to G21

for the micro sd module :
3.3v to 3.3v
GND to ground
MOSI to the same MOSI as the lcd and touch interface MISO,
CS is G5
CLK is G18 except if it interferes with the others on the same pin
